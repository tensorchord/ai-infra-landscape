# Landscape2 guide
#
# This file allows defining the content of the landscape guide.
#
# The landscape guide is organized into categories and subcategories. Each of
# these entities requires a name and some content. The content can be provided
# in markdown format. Categories and subcategories names are not required to
# match the ones defined in the landscape data file but, when they do, those
# categories/subcategories will be enriched with some extra information. So
# whenever possible, it's highly recommended that they do.
#
# We recommend using headings of level 4-6 within the content blocks as levels
# 1-3 are reserved to illustrate the hierarchy of categories and subcategories.
